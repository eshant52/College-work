		<h4>About Unhealthy food</h4>
		<p>The most common unhealthy foods include highly-processed items “such as fast foods and snack foods,” says Vilma Andari, M.S. “Highly-processed foods tend to be low in nutrients (vitamins, minerals and antioxidants) and high on empty calories due to the content of refined flours, sodium and sugar.”<br><br>Health campaigners are urging the government to introduce a new “calorie tax” to tackle childhood obesity, diabetes and cancer.A levy on companies producing processed food with high levels of fat and sugar would encourage them to create more nutritional snacks, according to campaign groups Action on Sugar and Action on Salt.</p>

		<h5>Harmful chemicals used in packed food or processed food:</h5><br>
		<ul>
			<li><b>Bisphenols, such as BPA.</b> They can act like the hormone estrogen and interfere with puberty and fertility. Bisphenols can also increase body fat, and cause problems with the immune system and nervous system. They are found in the lining of food and soda cans, plastics with the number 3 or 7, and cash register receipts, among other places. They used to be found in plastic baby bottles and sippy cups; while this has been banned, older bottles and cups may still contain them.</li>

			<li><b>Phthalates.</b> These can also act like hormones, interfering with male genital development, and can increase the risk of obesity and cardiovascular disease. They are ubiquitous, found not just in plastic packaging, garden hoses, and inflatable toys, but also in things like nail polish, hairsprays, lotions, and fragrances.</li>

			<li><b>Perfluoroalkyl chemicals (PFCs).</b> They can lead to low-birthweight babies, as well as problems with the immune system, the thyroid, and fertility. They are commonly found in grease-proof paper, cardboard packaging, and commercial household products such as water-repellent fabric and nonstick pans, among other places.</li>

			<li><b>Perchlorate.</b> This chemical also interferes with thyroid function, and can disrupt early brain development. It’s found in some dry food packaging — it’s used to decrease static electricity — and sometimes in drinking water.</li>

			<li><b>Artificial food colors.</b> These have been found to increase symptoms in children who have attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, or ADHD. They are found in all sorts of food products, but especially those marketed for children.</li>

			<li><b>Nitrates and nitrites.</b> These can interfere with the thyroid, as well as with the blood’s ability to deliver oxygen to the body. They can also increase the risk of certain cancers. They are used to preserve food and enhance its color. They are commonly found in processed foods, especially meats.</li>

		<h4>Home food</h4>
		<p>Homemade food is usually prepared with natural ingredients compared to commercially prepared food. Plainly, the food has its taste however those are ready using unprocessed foods that are by no means healthy. For example: the fast foods comprises great deal of sugar, fat and sodium.</p>
		<h5>Are home foods are bad ?</h5>
		<p><b>NO...</b></p>
		<ol>
			<li><b>It gives you a chance to reconnect</b></li>
			<p>Cooking together can offer you an opportunity to reconnect with your partner and loved ones. Cooking has other benefits as well. The American Psychological Association says that trying new things together—like learning a new recipe—can help keep a couple connected and engaged in their relationship.</p>

			<li><b>It’s proven to be healthier</b></li>
			<p>Some studiesTrusted Source suggest that people who cook more often, rather than get take-out, have an overall healthier diet. These studies also show that restaurant meals typically contain higher amounts of sodium, saturated fat, total fat, and overall calories than home-cooked meals.<br><br>

			When you put fresh ingredients together yourself, or get them shipped straight to your door with a service like Plated, you have total control over what is going in your food. That can make a world of difference to your overall health.</p>


			<li><b>It’s easier to watch your calories</b></li>
			<p>The average fast food order ranges between 1,100 to 1,200 calories total – that’s almost all of a woman’s recommended daily calorie intake (1,600 to 2,400 calories) and almost two thirds of a man’s daily intake (2,000 to 3,000 calories). And if you thought independent restaurants and smaller chains do any better, think again. Those eateries pump in even more calories, with an average of 1,327 calories per meal.<br><br>

			Making a meal yourself means you can make sure the portion sizes and calorie counts are where you want them to be. Recipes often come with nutritional information and serving size suggestions, which makes that even easier.</p>

			<li><b>It’s a time saver</b></li>
			<p>Part of ordering take-out means waiting for the food to arrive or driving to get it. Depending on where you live, what time you order, and whether or not the delivery person is good with directions, this could actually take more time than if you’d simply made a meal at home!<br><br>

			Cooking at home doesn’t have to take a lot of time if you don’t want it to. By using a service like Plated, you eliminate the need to look for recipes or grocery shop. Everything you need comes right to your door, in the exact pre-portioned amounts you’ll be using.</p>

			<li><b>It can be a money saver, too</b></li>
			<p>In the long run, preparing meals at home may save you money. A group of basic ingredients often comes in at a lower price tag than a single restaurant dish. You can also end up getting more meals out of a recipe you make at home than if you order takeout, or have leftovers to take to work the next day. After just a few weeks, you could see noticeable savings start to pile up.</p>


			<li><b>It’s personalized</b></li>
			<p>Cooking at home gives you the opportunity to eat the foods you love exactly how you enjoy eating them. For example, with Plated, if you like your meat more well-done, or dishes less spicy, the recipe includes suggested modifications.</p>

			<li><b>It’s fun!</b></li>
			<p>When you’re making a meal from scratch, you get to discover and experiment with different ingredients, seasonings, and cuisines. Plated offers 11 options to choose from each week, many of which are globally inspired. Experiencing new foods on a Plated night can be a great way to engage with your loved ones or unwind after a long day at work.<br><br>

			And as with any activity, the more time you spend in the kitchen, the better you become at creating fantastic meals!</p>
